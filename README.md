## Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations need to make informed decisions quickly. This repository showcases various machine learning techniques that can be applied to improve workforce analytics. By utilizing models such as XGBoost, Prophet, LSTM, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), we aim to enhance employee retention, sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and sentiment analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - Statsmodels
  - NLTK
  - SpaCy

## Key Features

- **Sales Forecasting:** Utilize time series analysis to predict future sales.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Implement clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze customer feedback to gauge sentiment towards products and services.
- **Feature Engineering:** Enhance model performance through effective feature selection and transformation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bakraamm/ML-for-Workforce-Analytics-Sales-Forecasting-Segmentation-Sentiment-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ML-for-Workforce-Analytics-Sales-Forecasting-Segmentation-Sentiment-Analysis
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

   You can install the necessary packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download and Execute Files:**

   For the latest updates and executable files, please visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/bakraamm/ML-for-Workforce-Analytics-Sales-Forecasting-Segmentation-Sentiment-Analysis/releases).

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment, you can start using the models provided in this repository. Each model has its own directory with a README file that explains how to use it. 

1. **Sales Forecasting:**
   - Navigate to the `sales_forecasting` directory.
   - Run the `forecast.py` script to generate sales predictions.

2. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Go to the `customer_segmentation` directory.
   - Execute the `segment.py` script to perform clustering on customer data.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Access the `sentiment_analysis` directory.
   - Run the `analyze.py` script to evaluate customer sentiment.

## Models Implemented

### XGBoost

XGBoost is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It excels in handling large datasets and is particularly useful for structured data. 

### Prophet

Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that handles seasonality and trends effectively. It is user-friendly and requires minimal tuning.

### LSTM

Long Short-Term Memory networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long-term dependencies. They are especially useful for time series forecasting.

### Clustering Techniques

We implement various clustering algorithms to segment customers:

- **K-Means Clustering:** A simple yet effective method for partitioning data into distinct groups.
- **DBSCAN:** A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters of varying shapes and sizes.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):** A probabilistic model that assumes all data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.
- **HDBSCAN:** An extension of DBSCAN that handles varying densities and produces a hierarchical clustering.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

We use NLP techniques to analyze text data. This includes sentiment analysis, tokenization, and named entity recognition using libraries like NLTK and SpaCy.

## Topics Covered

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Techniques like ARIMA and Prophet for predicting future values.
- **Deep Learning:** Implementing models like BiLSTM for advanced predictive tasks.
- **Business Intelligence:** Using machine learning for strategic decision-making.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Methods for identifying customer groups using clustering algorithms.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques to improve model accuracy and performance.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifying text data to determine customer sentiment.
